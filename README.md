# SoccerAnalysis

# This was a final group project completed for Computational Analysis of Big Data at DIS Copenhagen.
# Using data from Wyscout, we used machine learning to predict the probability of a shot in soccer being a goal based on a variety of factors.
# An accompanying blog post was written, and it can be found at https://medium.com/@elizabeth.stilson/predicting-football-goals-using-machine-learning-5e72760a6e28.
